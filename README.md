# DM-Manager
Basic software that will use RNG to roll on several DnD tables in a short span of time (WIP / UNFINISHED). For example, generating a town by rolling for an event, 3 important buildings, and, if that building is a warehouse, it will roll on another table to determine details for that warehouse.

This software will have to be updated to include the other tables, and refactored to be more easily extended, so the code doesn't have to be modified.
